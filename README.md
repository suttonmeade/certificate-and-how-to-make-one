# certificate-and-how-to-make-one
Certificates are on websites (for example this one! https://github.com)

But this comes with a kit of how to create your VERY OWN certificate (only on windows.) Not Linux, Ubuntu, ChromeOS, Fedora, or any other opearating system that is not Windows. YOU NEED TO HAVE MICROSOFT(R) WINDOWS(R). This comes with a PDF of how to make one, and one made myself. Cool, right?
